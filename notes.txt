id issue with making search bar not whole way and for years aswell which is exact for 4 digit year
make 1986 and 2018 values not placeholders so can always filter
and also step default checked

issue with lots of divs and labels for form 

label not bold issue important

<?php
$pure_topics= array();
$mech_topics= array();
$stats_topics= array();

include_once ("connection.php");

$stmt = $conn -> prepare("SELECT * FROM questions ");
    $stmt -> execute();
    while ($row = $stmt -> fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)){
        $topic = $row["topic"];
        if ($row["area"] = 0){
            if (!in_array($topic, $pure_topics)) {
                $pure_topics[] = $topic;
            }
        }
        if ($row["area"] = 1){
            if (!in_array($topic, $mech_topics)) {
                $mech_topics[] = $topic;
            }
        }
        if ($row["area"] = 2){
            if (!in_array($topic, $stats_topics)) {
                $stats_topics[] = $topic;
            }
        }
    } 

print_r($pure_topics);
?>
prints nothing - as only used single equals

issue of not in being python syntax

              <?php
                    if ($status == TRUE){
                        foreach ($pure_topics as $topic => $count) {
                            echo '<input type="checkbox" name="topic" value="' . ($topic) . '" checked> ' . ($topic) . " ($count) <br>";
                        }
                    }
                    else{
                        foreach ($pure_topics as $topic => $count) {
                            echo '<input type="checkbox" name="topic" value="' . ($topic) . '"> ' . ($topic) . " ($count) <br>";
                        }
                    }
                ?>
                </div>


had the same name for things across pure and mech so needed to specify

have to double click to open - because has to initalise to none as the other none is the style sheet so added an or

post was only catching last checked

for filter validation need to use isset rather than empty

header not working beacuse was printing stuff to test

prepared statement was difficult for sql with arrays so did not do this, no risk of sql injection as all textboxes except from years which I will change to only allow numerical entry

was leaving one or two of areas empty then checking in sql producing error so made into one big list of topics as the area is not important for this bit 

after testing using the filters, issues seemed to arise from the POST or the session being too long
