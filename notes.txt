hr css not working due to bootstrap overriding so added important

echo quote problem again, note as a issue to check for in future if page with php does not load along with brakcets and semicolons 

got stuck on blank page when joining school with valid schoolID
this was because sql was tyring to create new user with only schoolid and no update to phpmyadmin as lots was null when not null validation

another error table

when added one that already existed, it stuck on white page- suggested something went wrong to not get to header from inside if statement, because misspelt schoolID 

when i entered a different code it successfully added to table but in my school showed other users

this got rid of both  $stmt = $conn -> prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE role=1 and schoolID == :schoolID");, tried double equals for both and single equals for both which worked 



#no-school{
  justify-content: center;
  display: flex;
}

/* Horizontal line */
hr {
  border:none !important;
  height: 2px !important;
  background-color:grey !important;
}
