<?php
$pure_topics= array();
$mech_topics= array();
$stats_topics= array();

include_once ("connection.php");

$stmt = $conn -> prepare("SELECT * FROM questions ");
    $stmt -> execute();
    while ($row = $stmt -> fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)){
        $topic = $row["topic"];
        if ($row["area"] = 0){
            if (!in_array($topic, $pure_topics)) {
                $pure_topics[] = $topic;
            }
        }
        if ($row["area"] = 1){
            if (!in_array($topic, $mech_topics)) {
                $mech_topics[] = $topic;
            }
        }
        if ($row["area"] = 2){
            if (!in_array($topic, $stats_topics)) {
                $stats_topics[] = $topic;
            }
        }
    } 

print_r($pure_topics);
?>
