got stuck on blank page when joining school with valid schoolID
this was because sql was tyring to create new user with only schoolid and no update to phpmyadmin as lots was null when not null validation

when i entered a different code it successfully added to table but in my school showed other users

this got rid of both  $stmt = $conn -> prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE role=1 and schoolID == :schoolID");, tried double equals for both and single equals for both which worked 

echoing needed to stop and start for php

#no-school{
  justify-content: center;
  display: flex;
}

/* Horizontal line */
hr {
  border:none !important;
  height: 2px !important;
  background-color:grey !important;
}
