error messages!! - use session variables (dont need to get rid of as will erase when session times out or sign out ending session, tried that didnt work so reset)
will do if try again, so reset at top of create and sign in pages

first tested without validation to see if work
commented out header
special chars to avoid attacks and prepare statements to avoid sql injection
hash password
tested that id fetching worked
deleted test user
different redirection to test as not yet had error messages

sign out not working because did not start session
