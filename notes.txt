need to get in lack of school id issue on in school page

when i entered a different code it successfully added to table but in my school showed other users

this got rid of both  $stmt = $conn -> prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE role=1 and schoolID == :schoolID");, tried double equals for both and single equals for both which worked 

echoing needed to stop and start for php

#no-school{
  justify-content: center;
  display: flex;
}

/* Horizontal line */
hr {
  border:none !important;
  height: 2px !important;
  background-color:grey !important;
}
