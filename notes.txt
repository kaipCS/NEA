when doing exlcluding for step I pure - include some mech questions?/ same thing for not excluding, clearly filtering is going wrong ** 

echo "
                        <div class='button question-row' onclick=\"window.location.href='display-question.php?id={$row['questionid']}'\">
                            STEP $paper {$row['year']} {$row['topic']}
                            <div class='grey-text'>$keywordList</div>
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        ";
had to concanate differently as the html was not working when split up 

had to do research for this   to realod with value in search bar  <script>
    function sortQuestions(sortValue) {
        window.location.href = window.location.pathname + '?sort=' + sortValue;
    }
    </script>

to add just added straight latex into the webpage using research from earlier 
Got error about questions parts
Things initalised at the start of step papers needed to be at the start of mine aswell so looked back at raw papers from step database wesbite

when testing without using questions parts, the lines are cut off

with question parts need to enurmate so code to alter these bits

svg vs chtml fixes it which uses an image rather than html

issue of not keeping filters when reloading for displaying questions

    <div id="question-preview" class="col-sm-4">
        <div id ="latex-question">
            <?php
                if (isset($_SESSION["display-code"])){
                    echo($_SESSION["display-code"]);
                }
                else{
                    echo("Select a question to view it ");
                }
                unset($_SESSION["display-code"]);
            ?>
        </div>

    </div>

cannot resolve without major changes

move onto fixing questions parts issue

now i need to go through a sample to check for other latex package issues - i can see many arrising from tikz so will especially check geomety questions
for testing make page where can see all questions

using text area rather than text for notes input

last thing to do: debug the late

impossible to get the diagrams to work so had to use as images - seemed like all used \begin{center} so searched the database and downloaded images

ask RIC if okay if just rpoof of concept: only fix question parts as affect majoirty and that is neccesary and images as the pdf builder should work fine with this being only issue

sorting not working for result of search
