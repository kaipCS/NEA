\item 
The curve $C_1$ has parametric equations $x=t^2$, $y= t^3$, where 
$-\infty < t < \infty\,$. 
Let $O$ denote the point $(0,0)$.
The points $P$ and $Q$ on $C_1$  are such that $\angle POQ$ is
a right angle. Show that the tangents to $C_1$  at $P$ and $Q$ 
intersect on the curve $C_2$  with equation $4y^2=3x-1$.

Determine whether  $C_1$ and $C_2$ meet, and sketch the two
curves on the same axes.

\item 
The point $P(a\sec \theta, b\tan \theta )$ 
lies on the hyperbola 
\[
\dfrac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}-\dfrac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1\,,
\]
where $a>b>0\,$. 
Show that the equation of the 
tangent to the hyperbola at $P$ can be written as
\[
bx- ay \sin\theta  = 
ab \cos\theta
\,.
\]

\subpart This tangent  meets the 
lines
$\dfrac x a = \dfrac yb$ and $\dfrac x a =- \dfrac y b$
at
    $S$ and $T$,
    respectively. 

How is  the mid-point of $ST$
related to $P$?

\subpart
The point $Q(a\sec \phi, b\tan \phi)$ also lies on the
hyperbola and  the tangents to the 
hyperbola at $P$ and $Q$ 
    are perpendicular.               
These two  tangents intersect at $(x,y)$. 

Obtain expressions for $x^2$ and $y^2$ in terms of $a$, $\theta$ and $\phi$.

Hence, or otherwise,
show that
    $x^2+y^2 = a^2 -b^2$.
